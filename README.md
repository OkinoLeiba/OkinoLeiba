- 👋 Hi, I’m @OkinoLeiba
- 👀 I’m interested in anything outdoors, all sports, cooking and baking, brewaries, beaches bitches, etc.
- 🌱 I’m currently mastering C++, C#, python, PL/SQL, SQL Server, Java, etc.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that will help me build my acumen.
- 📫 How to reach me: two dixie cups and string, for now.

  > But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
